/*
Task #5 {Submit in the week starting 20th April}

Tie One On, an exclusive menâ€™s clothing store specializing in ties,
is planning to develop a store in a new shopping mall.
Customers are expected to arrive at the store location at random
at an average rate of 40 per hour. I.e. IAT : Normal Distr. {60/40;6/40} (minutes).
The store will be open 10 hours per day. Service time (of a customer) is assumed
to follow a normal distribution {6,1} (minutes).
The average sale to a customer is $22. Clerks are paid $20/hr.
(including all benefits), and the cost of having a waiting customer
is estimated to be $10 per customer per hour.
One possibility is to have a small store staffed by 2 clerks This store,
however, will only have room for a maximum of 3 customers to be present.
Another possibility is to have a larger store with 6 clerks.
The larger store can accommodate up to a total of 15 customers.
It is believed that customers who arrive when the store is full will shop elsewhere.
If the small store leases for $200 per day and the large store leases for $ 2000 per day,
which configuration should be used?

Develop a computer program to solve the above problem (via the simulation approach)
